# what-to-watch

Final Project for Sinatra Unit of Learn.co's Fullstack Web Developer Program

This Sinatra App creates a database of shows for a user to keep track of all the shows that they watch.

## Installation

Clone repository, then navigate into the repository folder in terminal.
You might need to run `bundle install` to install gem dependencies, then `rake db:migrate` to create the database for the first time.

## Usage

Run `shotgun` to start the server, then navigate to [localhost:9393](localhost:9393) in your browser to launch the app.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. You can run `rake console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
